# Smart Contract - Joint Savings Account

In this assignment, a solidity smart contract is created that replicates the fuinctioning of a joint savings account. This contract accepts two user addresses that are then able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement various requirements from the financial institution to provide the features of the joint 
savings account.

The following steps are performed: 
1. Create and work within a local blockchain development environment using the JavaScript VM provided by the Remix IDE.
2. Script and deploy a **JointSavings** smart contract.
